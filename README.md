### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Sass custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Implementing Sass Nested properties is is such a great choice instead of vanilla Css. Makes easy to search where code was writen.


```scss
.some-element-with-border {
  border: 3px solid transparent;

  &:hover{
    border: 3px solid $color;
  }
}

```
